## About

This tool generates json from comments contained in the source code. Main use-case for it is to create automatic issues based on TODO/FIXME/BUG/HACK comments. This tool supports additional tag information in the comment (Category, Issue etc.). Originally designed to be used for project management automation with [tdg-import](https://github.com/ribtoks/kanboard-tdg-import) plugin for Kanboard - you can read more in [this blogpost](https://codejamming.org/2019/how-to-return-to-flow).

Example of the comment (everything but the first line is optional):

    // TODO: This is title of the issue to create
    // category=SomeCategory issue=123 estimate=30m
    // This is a multiline description of the issue
    // that will be in the "Body" property of the comment

Sample generated json (if run in this repository root as `tdg -verbose`):

    {
      "root": "/Users/ribtoks/go/src/github.com/ribtoks/tdg",
      "branch": "master",
      "author": "Taras Kushnir",
      "project": "tdg",
      "comments": [
        {
          "type": "TODO",
          "title": "This is title of the issue to create",
          "body": "This is a multiline description of the issue\nthat will be in the \"Body\" property of the comment",
          "file": "README.md",
          "line": 19,
          "issue": 123,
          "category": "SomeCategory",
          "estimate": 0.5
        }
      ]
    }

Supported comments: `//`, `/*`, `#`, `%`, `;;` (adding new supported comments is trivial).

## Install

As simple as

    go get github.com/ribtoks/tdg

## Build

As simple as

    go build

## Usage

    -help
    	Show help
    -include value
    	Include pattern (can be specified multiple times)
    -log string
    	Path to the logfile (default "tdg.log")
    -min-chars int
    	Include comments with more chars than this (default 30)
    -min-words int
    	Skip comments with less than minimum words (default 3)
    -root string
    	Path to the the root of source code (default "./")
    -stdout
    	Duplicate logs to stdout
    -verbose
    	Output human-readable json

Example:

    tdg -root ~/Projects/xpiks-root/xpiks/src/ -include "\.(cpp|h)$" -verbose

Include pattern is a regexp. With verbose flag you get human-readable json and log output in stdout. Without verbose flag this tool could be used as input for smth else like `curl`.
